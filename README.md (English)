# **ðŸ’¡ AI Specialist Portfolio & Growth Strategy (Park Yeonwoo)**

Applicant: Park Yeonwoo  
Core Strength: Non-Major Domain Expertise (Language Translation/Accounting) combined with AI Tool Proficiency.

## **ðŸ“Œ Key Project: AI Communication Strategy for Bridging the Tech Gap (PREP Structure)**

This project demonstrates my ability to solve the **'communication barrier'** problem that arose from complex technical information during my NVIDIA training.

| Section | Summary of Action | Core Competency Demonstrated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P (Problem)** | Complex AI coding concepts acted as an **information barrier**, hindering project understanding among non-technical team members. | **Problem Definition** and **Business Acumen** |
| **R (Resolution)** | Instead of showing raw Jupyter code, I converted the content into a visual **HTML Presentation.** Used **Gemini** to simplify technical jargon and clarify concepts. | **AI Tool Proficiency** (Leveraging Gemini for summary) & **Visualization Skills** |
| **O (Outcome)** | The visual HTML presentation led to an **estimated 40% increase in project understanding** among non-technical teammates. Integrated all files into GitHub for easy **resource accessibility.** | **Communication Efficiency** & **Organizational Skills** |
| **P (Perspective)** | This experience confirms my role in AI is not coding, but being a **'Communication Specialist' who translates complex technology into clear business value.** | **Clear Vision and Role Recognition** |

## **ðŸš€ Vision: 3-Year Growth Roadmap**

My growth does not stop with the 6-month training. My concrete plan for the next three years post-hiring is detailed below.

* **Phase 1 (Year 1):** AI Application Specialist (Focus on AI Quality Assurance, Service Planning, and leveraging domain knowledge).  
* **Phase 2 (Year 2):** AI Knowledge Expander (Learning core AI model principles and basic Cloud/Deployment techniques).  
* **Phase 3 (Year 3):** AI Developer/Engineer Competence (Participating in model design, fine-tuning, and large-scale deployment).

**The detailed plan can be found in the [3-Year AI Specialist Growth Roadmap](https://github.com/Salmonyeonwoo/portfolio/blob/52b1a2712ad1bc2de7e6f7472f9ffefb01a32c3d/README.md(English)) file.**
