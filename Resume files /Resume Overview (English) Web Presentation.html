                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Solution: Step 1 (Compliance): During the required ownership verification process using payment history/contact email, Step 2 (Escalation): Immediately escalated or requested assistance from seniors upon judging the inquiry as unusual. Step 3 (Completion): Account authentication/linking procedure was carried out and a resolution email was sent ONLY after the senior team member confirmed the identity of the true owner through secondary security data. For inquiries regarding suspended or deleted accounts, the case was escalated using a dedicated macro to the respective specialized team member after confirming the reason.</p>

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">Role: For refund requests concerning 3rd party providers without Roblox authority such as Apple Store, Amazon, Xsolla (a payment processor similar to Paypal using email accounts), directly requested refunds using the dedicated macro for each company. For Google Play and Paypal, information like the GPA number or official Paypal transaction number was received and forwarded directly to the Billing team member. (Approval / denial decision was made by the Billing team member.)</p>

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1">Issue: While inquiries about unauthorized charges from hackers were present, the majority were refund requests due to minors under 14 secretly making multiple small game item purchases using their guardian/parent's phone.</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Solution: For refund inquiries related to hacker-induced payments, a confirmation request was first sent to the seniors/experts within the Billing team, and a guided macro was responded according to their instructions. For unauthorized charges made by minors, official number information was requested, shared with the Billing team member, and resolution was requested.

                <!-- Issue and Solution: Uniform paragraph styling for consistent left alignment -->
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1">Issue: Customer completed the purchase and payment of Robux products, but upon checking again several days later, the corresponding Robux item was not credited.</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Solution: For Google Play, customers were requested to wait for approximately 4 business days depending on the system status of the account history. If the issue persisted, the official GPA number included in the receipt was shared with the Billing team members to confirm the uncredited Robux and whether to approve/deny payment. If approved, the reply was sent after the Robux payment was completed; if denied, a detailed explanation with the reason was provided.</p>
