Core Strength: Non-Major Domain Expertise (Language Translation/Accounting) combined with AI Tool Proficiency.

## **📌 Key Project: AI Communication Strategy for Bridging the Tech Gap (PREP Structure)**

My growth does not stop with the 6-month training. My concrete plan for the next three years post-hiring is detailed below.

* **Phase 1 (Year 1):** AI Application Specialist (Focus on AI Quality Assurance, Service Planning, and leveraging domain knowledge).  
* **Phase 2 (Year 2):** AI Knowledge Expander (Learning core AI model principles and basic Cloud/Deployment techniques).  
* **Phase 3 (Year 3):** AI Developer/Engineer Competence (Participating in model design, fine-tuning, and large-scale deployment).
