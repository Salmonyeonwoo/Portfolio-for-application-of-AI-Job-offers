## **🚀 Vision: 3-Year Growth Roadmap**

My growth does not stop with the 6-month training. My concrete plan for the next three years post-hiring is detailed below.

* **Phase 1 (Year 1):** AI Application Specialist (Focus on AI Quality Assurance, Service Planning, and leveraging domain knowledge).  
* **Phase 2 (Year 2):** AI Knowledge Expander (Learning core AI model principles and basic Cloud/Deployment techniques).  
* **Phase 3 (Year 3):** AI Developer/Engineer Competence (Participating in model design, fine-tuning, and large-scale deployment).

I'll share some process of projects via Jupyter notebook via below file link

a. After downloading the file, open it with Notepad.

b. Once the file is open in Notepad, use "Save As" or press Ctrl + S to save it, making sure the file name ends with .html or .HTML.

c. If it doesn't run after saving, try using the "Rename" option. If spaces in the file name are not being recognized, please replace them with an underscore (_).

d. After that, please check if the file icon has changed to your default internet browser's icon. If it has, you can open it directly.

🚀 Setup Instructions
Since this project uses the Gemini API, you need to set up an API key to run it.

Rename the config.example.js file to config.js.

Open the config.js file and enter your Gemini API key as the value for the apiKey variable.

Open the Voice_of_AI_features.html file in your browser to run the project.

Note: The config.js file is managed by .gitignore, so it will not be uploaded to GitHub.
