## **🚀 Vision: 3-Year Growth Roadmap**

My growth does not stop with the 6-month training. My concrete plan for the next three years post-hiring is detailed below.

* **Phase 1 (Year 1):** AI Application Specialist (Focus on AI Quality Assurance, Service Planning, and leveraging domain knowledge).  
* **Phase 2 (Year 2):** AI Knowledge Expander (Learning core AI model principles and basic Cloud/Deployment techniques).  
* **Phase 3 (Year 3):** AI Developer/Engineer Competence (Participating in model design, fine-tuning, and large-scale deployment).

I'll share some process of projects via Jupyter notebook via below file link.
